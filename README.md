# flutter-google-i18n-demo

Demo of internationalizing a Flutter app with Google spreadsheet.

## Getting Started

The app fetches translations from Google spreadsheet located here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TGbtKpdNRptYwUVtqmkI2L7Ix00i-fQMnrChGHx2Ajk/edit?usp=sharing

It caches the data for offline use and if there's no internet connection, it will automatically use the cached data.
